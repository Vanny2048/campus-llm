## Email 1: General RSO Outreach

**Subject:** Let's Put LMU Back on the Map—Partner on Game Days, Tailgates, & Big Prizes!

Hey [Org Leader/Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm building something brand new for LMU—Campus LLM, our first-ever student-driven events and rewards platform, all about making campus spirit real again (think: next-level tailgates, wild game-day prizes, and actually packed stands).

We want RSOs like yours at the center of it all—hosting official tailgates, planning watch parties, and (if you're down) helping pick out-of-the-box prizes like "Day as LMU President," "Coach for a Day," and more. Your org will get first choice of events, exclusive promo, and a say in leaderboard prizes—with zero hassle on your end.

Could we set up a super quick chat this week about making [Org Name] a launch partner for LMU's most hype semester ever? Huge upside for your events, and we handle all the details.

Let me know if you're interested!

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Tailgates, watch parties, and real-time student challenges are just the beginning.

Would Student Affairs be interested in collaborating on:

• Student engagement initiatives
• Resource integration

I'd appreciate the chance to chat about partnership ideas or next steps, even if just for 15 minutes.
