# LinkedIn Recruitment Post

ðŸš¨ LMU is about to LEVEL UPâ€¦ and I need your help to make it legendary.

It's time to revamp Campus LLMâ€”not just an AI answering questions, but the heartbeat of campus life: think wild tailgates, packed game-watch parties, out-of-the-box prizes (like "Day as President"ðŸ‘€), and a leaderboard where showing up finally means something.

But real talk: I can't do this alone. If you care about storytelling, visuals, or just making student life way more hypeâ€”your energy belongs here.

**Who I'm searching for (no tech experience required!):**

ðŸŽ¬ **Content Creators & Editors**: Bring events to life with TikToks, Instagram Reels, motion graphics, memesâ€”we want every scroll to scream LMU.

ðŸ“¸ **Photographers/Videographers**: Capture epic moments at tailgates, games, watch parties, and "Spirit MVP" reveals!

ðŸŽ¨ **Designers/Branding Heads**: Shape our look, from logos to event flyers to leaderboard animations.

ðŸ“£ **PR & Marketing People**: Help write our story, get press, and make sure this hits every LMU group chat and newsfeed.

ðŸ§‘ðŸŽ¤ **Student Promoters/Ambassadors**: Rally orgs, frats, sororities; be the face on the ground driving turnout (and scoring some major LMU clout).

ðŸ•¹ **Event-Planners/Idea People**: Dream up wild new ways to build tradition (theme nights? game-day quests? you tell me).

ðŸ§ª **Beta Testers**: Try it first, break it, tell us what to fixâ€”real feedback shapes what we build.

**What's new this time?**
- Tailgate leaderboards + live event check-ins
- VIP access for top scorers (think: floor seats, meet the mascot, wild "Student for a Day" swaps)
- Creative spirit challenges and "Spirit Olympiad" competitions between clubs, frats/sororities, and friends
- No more group chat confusion. Know what's happening, every day.

If you want to collabâ€”even just for a week or one crazy ideaâ€”jump in!

Low commitment, high impact, real community.
